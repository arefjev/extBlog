# extBlog aka Extended Blog
## Django project for myself and skill tests

Django project with Django Rest Framework support, Vue.js frontend
With multiple apps like a blog (extended), a bot (possibly Telegram-bot), and possibly multiple third-party APIs support

In the process of writing a project, I want to try new ones for myself - the TDD methodology, front-end development and other technologies.

I hope everything works out.
